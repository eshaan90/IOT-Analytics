# IOT Analytics

This repository contains 5 machine learning based projects on IOT data. For all projects, the dataset was created by simulation. 

1. Clustering (K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN, and GMM)
2. Linear Regression (Polynomial Regression and Residual Analysis)
3. IOT Simulation 
3. Time Series Forecasting (Tests for Stationarity, Simple Moving Average, Exponential Moving Average, AutoRegression Model)
5. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
